.SH SYNOPSIS
simple_shell
.TP
.SH DESCRIPTION
is a basic UNIX shell that provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the operating system.
The shell reads commands from the user, executes them, and returns the result. It supports both built-in commands and external program execution.

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.B simple_shell
operates in an interactive loop, displaying a
.B "$ "
prompt when reading input from a terminal.
Input is read using the
.B getline
function and tokenized with the
.B tokenize_input
function to extract commands and arguments.
To execute commands, a child process is created using
.B fork(2),
and the command is executed in the child process with
.B execve(2).
If the user enters the
.B exit
command, the program terminates with a status of 0.
